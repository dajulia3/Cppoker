Cppoker

A poker game implemented in C++. YUCK!

Changes from last version

I thought it would be more fun to do a No limit poker game, so instead of just
betting 1 or 2 chips the players can bet as many chips as they have.
Although this makes some of the coding a little more complex, the end result is
a game that is much more fun to play.

Additionally, it is intentional that a person can play poker alone, though the whole idea of 
betting becomes pointless.

Seven Card stud: the ranking doesn't work yet. To be fixed if I ever decide to put myself
through the pain of C++ in the near future.
